        This will take input for the title and description, and then will have
        you choose from predefined fields (<leader>ca style) for things like
        project, assignee, etc.

    - list
    - search

### Projects

        Think like a git branch switch that can have an indicator in the shell

    - list
    - create
        - team

        - issues(?)
        - members

### Workspaces

As much as I would love to be able to easily switch between workspaces on the
fly, I don't think that the API permits that since there would be a separate API
key for each workspace.

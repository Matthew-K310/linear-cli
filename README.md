# linear-cli

A bit of a project of necessity for me.

I use [Linear](https://linear.app) for almost all of my project planning, and while I love their UI, I don't like having to switch context between my terminal and my browser every time I need to make some changes.

The goal of this project is to create a command line app that will let me create, edit, and view issues, as well as view my projects and teams. This way, I can do everything from the comfort of my terminal (which, if we're being honest, most of us live in the terminal anyway ðŸ˜…).
